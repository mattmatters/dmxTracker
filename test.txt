Rapper DMX, also known as Earl Simmons, has been charged and arrested for "engaging in a multi-year scheme to conceal millions of dollars of income from the IRS," noted the Department of Justice in a statement on Thursday. In the last seven years, he has avoided paying $1.7 million worth of tax liabilities, according to the DoJ.
Just about three weeks after entering rehab, the perpetually-troubled DMX is sober. His lawyer Murray Richman said as much to TMZ earlier this week.
According to Richman, X is "back to being human again" after entering a New England rehab facility in late August. Richman says X had reached an unhealthy level of thinness when he entered the rehab facility, but now he's gained 40 pounds.

Ricman says X's rehab program is technically complete, but he wants the rapper to stay an extra 30 days because he's been doing so well with the treatment. X isn't on lockdown, though, and they're actually letting he and a friend take day trips to a nearby town. Sounds like he's getting the help he needs.

It's great to see DMX has, for the moment, conquered his drug addiction, but he's still got some serious legal battles to face in the very near future. This past July, X was hit with tax evasion charges of $1.7 million. X faces up to 44 years in prison if he's convicted on all 14 counts of tax evasion.
Richman says he and X will worry about the rapper's impending court battle when X has completed his rehab program once and for all. He also says X hasn't discounted the possibility of going on tour in the future.
It's been quite a tumultuous few months for DMX. From being accused of tax evasion to being placed on house arrest, the rapper's legal woes have nearly driven him to put his music on hold.

But it appears as though things are finally looking up for the hip-hop heavyweight following a reportedly successful stint in rehab.

According to TMZ, the Yonkers born lyricist has packed on 40 pounds since entering a New England treatment facility in August. X's lawyer, Murray Richman, also shared that the rapper is “back to being human again.”

Although the program is almost complete, Richman suggests X will remain in rehab for 30 more days since it's had a positive effect on the emcee. X has even been granted day visits with a friend to a nearby town.

Back in mid-July, a lawsuit was filed alleging that the "Slippin'" rapper evaded $1.7 million in taxes. While X managed to make bail for the criminal case, the rapper failed to abstain from drugs and was subsequently placed on house arrest. X’s case, in which he is facing up to 44 years in prison if convicted, is still pending and will reportedly resume once he returns home from rehab.

DMX just might pull a Gucci Mane because X's lawyer tells us the rapper's cleaned up so much in rehab, he's "back to being human again."
We spoke with Murray Richman who told us X has already packed on 40 lbs. Murray says he had been nothing but skin and bones before starting treatment in late August at a New England facility.
The program is almost complete, but Murray wants X to stay another 30 days since he's been responding so well ... they're letting him take day trips with a friend to a nearby town.
We broke the story ... a judge signed off on rehab after the rapper said his house arrest for tax evasion wasn't helping him improve. Murray says they'll tackle the court case once DMX has successfully finished treatment. He's also not ruling out a tour in the future.
In August, DMX was sentenced to house arrest after reportedly failing four drug tests while out on bail for his federal tax evasion case. Soon thereafter, the New York native opted to enter rehab “to do something positive and better for myself.” It seems like the treatment has done wonders, as his attorney has shared his intentions to spend another 30 days in the New England facility to continue staying sober. What’s more, the hip-hop legend has packed 40 pounds onto his formerly gaunt frame thanks to good ol’ Captain Crunch.

TMZ recently learned the secret of DMX’s weight gain when they spoke to him outside of a New York City court hearing. When asked what he’d been eating to pack on the pounds, a member of the rapper’s crew answered “cereal” before DMX himself name-dropped his favorite cereal.

DMX has a long history of battling drug addiction and legal issues, so here’s to hoping he continues on the road to recovery. The rapper faces 14 counts of tax fraud and faces up to 44 years in prison after being arrested in July.
